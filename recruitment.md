## Payments to Contributors

The process of being paid for contributions to the Decred project is based on demonstrating the quality of your work before being "cleared" to receive payments for your contributions. 

A rough outline of the process:

* introduce yourself and the kind of work you intend to do
* submit a small piece of work for review to one of the established contributors in the relevant domain
* they will discuss it with you, considering whether the quality of your work is of a sufficient standard to receive payment or whether improvements would be required
* submit more work for review, if it is well received you could start taking on bigger jobs on the expectation that they too would be approved

In the case of a dispute between you and whoever is reviewing your work, ask other people who are active in that domain for input. If that fails to resolve the issue, the dispute resolution process is to make the issue public and hear the arguments from both sides, then hold some form of ticket vote to resolve it (details tbc as this has not yet been required). 

Established contributors per domain:

_With this kind of approach, being cleared to clear others is a status individuals can hold (or not), probably important to be transparent about who holds this permission/authority_
