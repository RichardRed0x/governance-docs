# governance-docs
Concept sandbox repository: Policies and sample documents for Decred project that should only be edited with Voter approval.

Documents like the Decred Constitution define a set of policies which guide contributors to the project. Looking at Politiea's development, with a view to it taking over as the major decision-making force of the project, there is a already a need for additional documents that clearly define processes (e.g. what is the proposal submission, review and payment process) and principles which are fundamental to how Decred's off-chain governance works.

These documents need to have the backing of stakeholders to be effective, and so it makes sense that they be ratified by ticket-voting. They should also be subject to change, as nobody expects everything to work perfectly immediately.

Proposals that are Pull Requests to change these documents, subject to Politeia Vote for review, would be an easily-automatable mechanism for deciding and describing how the various aspects of Decred's governance works.

A set of initial documents to sketch out the concept:
*/constitution.md
*/recruitment.md
*/politeia.md
*/proposal_guidelines.md
*/budget/examplebudget.md
*/reporting/examplereport.md
